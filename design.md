# Design Document for The Lord of the Rings SDK

## Overview

This document outlines the design decisions and architecture of the Lord of the Rings SDK, including its structure, components, and key design patterns used.

## Architecture

The SDK is designed to provide a simple and intuitive interface for accessing the Lord of the Rings API. It follows a modular architecture with separate components for different functionalities.

### Components

1. **Client**:
   - The main entry point for interacting with the SDK. It provides methods to fetch movies and quotes.
   - Responsible for initializing service classes (`MovieService` and `QuoteService`).

2. **Services**:
   - **MovieService**: Handles API requests related to movies.
   - **QuoteService**: Manages API requests for quotes.
   - Each service abstracts the API calls and returns data in a structured format.

3. **Models**:
   - **Movie**: Represents a movie object with attributes like ID, name, runtime, etc.
   - **Quote**: Represents a quote object with attributes like ID, dialog, movie reference, etc.
   - These models provide a clear structure for the data returned from the API.

4. **Validation**:
   - Input validation functions ensure that parameters passed to methods are of the expected type and value range.
   - Centralized validation logic helps maintain code quality and reduces duplication.

## Design Patterns and Principles

### Facade Pattern
- The `Client` class acts as a facade, providing a simplified interface for complex operations behind the scenes.

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### Separation of Concerns
- The SDK separates functionalities into distinct modules (e.g., validation, error handling, API interaction).

### Error Handling Strategy
- Custom exceptions allow for systematic error management, providing meaningful feedback to users.

### Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Model classes (`Movie` and `Quote`) serve as DTOs, encapsulating data returned from the API.

### Dependency Injection
- Services are injected into the `Client`, enhancing testability and flexibility.

## Future Considerations

- **Extensibility**: The design allows for easy addition of new features or endpoints by creating new methods in the service classes or extending the `Client` class.
- **Testing**: The SDK includes tests using `pytest`, ensuring that the implementation is robust and functioning as expected.

## Conclusion

The Lord of the Rings SDK is designed to be easy to use while providing all necessary functionality for accessing the API. The modular architecture and design patterns implemented contribute to maintainability and clarity.
